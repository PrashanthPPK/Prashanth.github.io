  - title: "Excel Report Generation for AtliQ Company"
    description: "The primary objective of the sales analytics project is to empower businesses to monitor and evaluate their sales activities and performance effectively. This involves creating detailed customer performance reports and comparing market performance with sales targets, helping businesses identify sales patterns, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and make data-driven decisions. These reports play a vital role in determining optimal customer discounts, negotiating with consumers, and pinpointing opportunities for business expansion in high-potential markets. Similarly, the finance report aims to generate Profit and Loss (P&L) statements segmented by fiscal year, months, and markets, supporting financial performance evaluation and decision-making. Analyzing finance data facilitates benchmarking against industry standards and past performance, forming a foundation for budgeting and forecasting, and aligning financial plans with strategic goals to foster confidence in the organizationâ€™s financial health. To execute these objectives, proficiency in ETL methodologies and technical skills such as creating date tables in Power Query, deriving fiscal periods, and establishing data model relationships using Power Pivot is essential. Additionally, expertise in DAX for calculated columns and incorporating supplementary data enhances model robustness. Alongside these technical skills, an in-depth understanding of sales and finance reporting, combined with user-centered report design and optimization, enables the creation of effective and insightful reports. This systematic, empathetic approach to report generation ensures that reports are not only accurate but also relevant and accessible to stakeholders, enhancing decision-making and strategic alignment."
